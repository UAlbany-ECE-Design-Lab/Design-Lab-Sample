# Design Lab Sample Repository (Read Me)
Include a very brief description (a couple sentences) of your project here. We will use this as the GitHub repository description.

# Repository Contents
This repository should contain the following information.  Briefly describe the contents for each item in the repository.
- REPORT:  All repositories must include a PDF copy of the final report. 
- VIDEO:  Include a copy of your final video.  This can be a link to YouTube (if the file is large >100MB) or copy of the video.
- SENSITIVE INFORMATION: Make sure to include any usernames, passwords, hostnames, and any other important information as an appendix in the report.  If you have any of this information, make sure to include two copies of the report.  One that does not contain this information and another labeled "REPORT_senstivitive.pdf" that contains this information as an appendix.  This will allow us to share your report with or without this information depending on the audience.  
- SOURCE CODE (if applicable):  All source code related to the project in a very well-organized fashion. 
- SIMULATIONS (if applicable):  Include any SPICE, Simulink, or other simulations that will be useful for a future team.  
- Please include any helpful pictures, images, design documents, or other work you have finalized if it will likely be helpful for a future team.

# Hardware Dependencies
- What hardware would the next team need to replicate your work? Include links to specific equipment when possible. 
- Who has the equipment (professor, stakeholder, etc...)?  Do they need to purchase anything? 
- Do they need to assembly anything to replicate your work, or is all together any ready?
- What testing equipment did you use? (if applicable)

# Software Dependencies
- Is there any software necessary to replicate your work? 
- Is the software free?  If you needed a license, how did you get access? 
- Are there any libraries that you used?  
- What development environment (IDE) did you use?  
- Any difficult set-up or configuration procedures? If so, please document.  
- Include links when possible.

# Replication 
- How should the next team run your work? 
- How do they know if they successfully replicated your work?  What results should they see? 
- Does the team need any testing equipment?
- What parts of the project are still work-in-progress? Make sure to clearly indicate this, as to not confuse the team.

# TO-DO
- Provide an example of critical next steps here.
- Bullet point out a few important tasks for the next team to accomplish
